# üö® URGENT: GitHub Pages Configuration Guide

## The issue: Your files are deployed but GitHub Pages is misconfigured!

Your repository at `https://github.com/rohan911438/karam-smart-file-agent` has all the right files, but GitHub Pages needs to be set up correctly.

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION:

### 1. Go to Your Repository Settings
- Navigate to: `https://github.com/rohan911438/karam-smart-file-agent`
- Click the **"Settings"** tab (at the top of the repository)

### 2. Find GitHub Pages Settings
- In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**

### 3. Configure Source Settings
You have **TWO OPTIONS**:

#### OPTION A: Deploy from Root (Recommended)
- **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
- **Branch**: Select "main"
- **Folder**: Select **"/ (root)"**
- Click **"Save"**

#### OPTION B: Deploy from docs folder
- **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"  
- **Branch**: Select "main"
- **Folder**: Select **"/docs"**
- Click **"Save"**

### 4. Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will show a message like "Your site is live at..."
- It takes **5-10 minutes** for changes to appear
- You'll see a green checkmark when ready

## üåê Your App URLs:

### If you chose OPTION A (root deployment):
- **Main App**: `https://rohan911438.github.io/karam-smart-file-agent/`
- **React App**: `https://rohan911438.github.io/karam-smart-file-agent/docs/`

### If you chose OPTION B (docs deployment):
- **Direct App**: `https://rohan911438.github.io/karam-smart-file-agent/`

## üîç How to Check if It's Working:

1. After 5-10 minutes, visit your GitHub Pages URL
2. If you see the Karam app loading, you're good!
3. If you still see 404, try these URLs:
   - `https://rohan911438.github.io/karam-smart-file-agent/docs/`
   - `https://rohan911438.github.io/karam-smart-file-agent/index.html`

## üö® Troubleshooting:

### If you still get 404:
1. **Check the Pages tab** in repository settings - it should show "Your site is published at..."
2. **Try the alternative URL**: Add `/docs/` to the end of your URL
3. **Check Actions tab**: Look for any failed deployments
4. **Force refresh**: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R in your browser

### Common Issues:
- **Cache**: Clear your browser cache
- **Timing**: GitHub Pages takes time to update
- **URL case**: Make sure the repository name matches exactly

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:

- ‚úÖ Karam Smart File Agent title

- ‚úÖ Drag and drop functionality
- ‚úÖ ZIP creation/extraction features
